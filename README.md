# project-library

This is Technigo's project for the second week. This is to implement a library with filtering and
sorting using vanilla javascript. It was an interesting project since I've mostly implemented
front end projects using javascript libraries like angular or react before this. 

## The problem

We are supposed to implement the library with different filters and sorting methods. I chose to 
implement it the way I did so that we can use different filters on top of each other. In my project,
you can filter by cuisine type AND the number of ingredients AND keyword search. You can also use 
just one of the aforementioned filters.

This project implements both the intermediate stretch goals (filtering by number of ingredients, 
sorting alphabetially) as well as the advanced stretch goals (implemeting search, additional filters, 
additonal sorting method).
